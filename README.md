# Kalman-Filter
In Statistics and Control Theory, Kalman Filtering is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based in a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe.
